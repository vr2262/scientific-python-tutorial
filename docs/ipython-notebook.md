Using the IPython Notebook
==========================

## Getting Started

You should have a virtual environment set up. Check [the README](README.md) and [the Anaconda guide](docs/anaconda-install.md). Install IPython in your environment if you haven't already.

## Running the Notebook Server

Enter your virtual environment. Your command line prompt should include `(your-environment-name)`. Now run this command:

`$ ipython notebook`

This will start the IPython notebook server process in your terminal and try to open the page `http://localhost:8888/` in your default browser.

This page shows you a directory listing and lets you create new IPython notebooks or view and edit existing ones. Notebook files have the `.ipynb` file extension.

## Stopping the Notebook Server

In the terminal window in which you ran the `ipython notebook` command, hit Control-C to stop the process.
